SOLID SNAKE
--------------------
Our final project is a Snake game. The snake is moved by UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT keys and the goal of the game is to gather as many snacks as possible. The game ends once you touch the walls surrounding the game area or if the snake tries to eat itself. Once the game is over you can restart the game using the ESCAPE key. Your score is tracked and displayed on a HEX display on the FPGA board used for this project.
